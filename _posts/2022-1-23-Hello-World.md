title: Hello World
---
"Hello World!" Anyone who has done a lick of programmming of any kind probably has these words burnt into their mind. The simple phrase "Hello World" really means so much more to those who have exposure to this school of knowledge. Not only are you simply greeting the planet on which we inhabit, but you are embarking on a new adventure in a brand new medium that you haven't really explored yet. It is every programmers first foray into whatever new language or program they are currently exploring, they are truly the words of a new beginning. That's why I think Hello World is a suitable title for my first post, not only because it was the default title for this template's first post (go figure) but because I truly beleive it encapsulates my begining in this new medium of blogging. A blog has always been something I have wanted to start myself but I here I am, freshly turned 25 years old and I am finally taking the plunge. You must know I am serious because I even paid for a custom domain name, how about that! So now with some skin in the game(about 14 dollars annually) I will now embark on this quest to share my opinions and insights to whoever cares to read them. I plan to post about topics relating to my interests in technology but every so often I may poke into other topics as well. If you want to know a little bit more about my background, you can check out my About page. Until next time!
