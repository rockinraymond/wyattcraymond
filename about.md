I am just another guy with an internet connection and a great interest in technology. I have been fascinated with computers and electronics for as long as I can remember and have spent countless hours reading and figuring out ways I can create new things. 

I have bachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering and experience working in the department of defense as a civilian intern, an army officer, and most recently as a contractor. I am currently going graduate school for electrical and computer engineering and I have been working as a Software Engineer on a Joint Staff contract since my release from active duty. I also have some experience with CompTia certifiactions, specifically Network+, which with the help of the Army and my current employer, I was able to study for, earn and maintain in my spare time. 

I have been making my own way into the field of technology and I've started this blog as a way to document my journey. If you happen to find anything on this webpage useful or entertaining, feel free to let me know, or not, either way its cool. Thanks for visiting!
