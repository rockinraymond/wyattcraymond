I am just another guy with an internet connection and a great interest in technology. I have fascinated with computers and electronics for as long as I can remember and have spent countless hours reading and figuring out ways I can create new things. I have bachelors degree in electrical and computer engineering and some experience working in the department of defense as both a civilian intern and an army officer. I am currently going back to graduate school to relearn some of the things that I have since forgotten since I graduated college and proceeded to not use my degree in any shape or form. I also have some experience with CompTia certifiactions, specifally the Network+ cert which with the help of the Army I was able to study for and earn in my spare time. I hope to break back into the field of technology and am starting this blog as a way to document my journey. If you happen to find anything on this webpage useful or entertaining, feel free to let me know, or not, either way its cool. Thanks for visiting!
